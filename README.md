Some of the code for my thesis titled "A STUDY ONDILATATIONMONOTONEMAPS AND THEHAEZENDONCK-GOOVAERTSRISKMEASURE". The thesis can be found here: 

Given time, or perhaps per request, I will write a more detailed readme, with some instructions on how to use the code. In the meantime, I hope the code is readable enough to get you going --- just don't forget to alter the file paths to suit your system.
